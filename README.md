# OpenCV Image Processing Showcase

This project is a **tutorial-style Jupyter Notebook** demonstrating the use of **OpenCV** Python Library for computer vision. It walks through fundamental and advanced image processing techniques with clear explanations, code, and visual results.

## Features Covered

- **Image Basics**
  - Color conversions: BGR ↔ RGB, Grayscale, HSV
  - Resizing, rotation, flipping

- **Drawing & Shapes**
  - Lines, rectangles, circles, text overlays

- **Filtering & Transformations**
  - Gaussian blur, median blur
  - Canny edge detection
  - Thresholding

- **Morphological Operations**
  - Erosion, dilation
  - Contour detection

- **Feature Detection**
  - ORB keypoints & descriptors

- **Segmentation**
  - GrabCut foreground/background separation

- **Face Detection**
  - Haar Cascades for face & eye detection

- **Real-Time Webcam Showcase**
  - Live effects: grayscale, blur, edges, face + eye detection
  - Toggle effects in real time
  - Save frames with timestamps
